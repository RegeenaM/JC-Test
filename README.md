# README

Coverage of tests is based on the requirements (acceptance criteria).  
No automated tests were included but existing tests would ideally be turned into automated tests.  
Test Scenarios were written as opposed to fully detailed test cases.  
For this to go in a real production env, I would implement the automated tests to help test some of the more difficult scenarios.
