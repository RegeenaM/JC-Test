Bug #1 (Test Scenario #5)
  1. Launch Application
  2. POST to hash as the following: curl -X POST -H "application/json" -d '{"password":"testing"}' http://127.0.0.1:8088/hash
  3. Observe the returned value
  Actual Result: Job identifier is not returned immediately, it is returned after 5 seconds 
  Expected Result: Job identifier is returned immediately 
Bug #2 (Test Scenario #8)
  1. Launch Applicaition
  2. POST to /hash and note the corresponding job identifiers returned for all POST to /hash since the server started
  3. GET to /hash with a job identifier that is a string OR is null
  Actual Result: The following error message is returned: strconv.Atoi: parsing "test": invalid syntax 
  Expected Result: A 400 error should be returned so that it doesn't give away the fact that strings are invalid 
Bug #3 (Test Scenario #11)
  1. Launch Application
  2. Send POST to /hash several times all at once 
  3. GET to /stats and note the values returns 
  Actual Result: milliseconds returned is incorrect as it's stating more time than it is actually taking (and some requests were rejected - could not readily reproduce this)
  Expected Result: milliseconds should be returned representing the correct time
